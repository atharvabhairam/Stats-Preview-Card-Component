# Stats Preview Card Component

This project is a **Stats Preview Card Component** built as part of a challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io). The component showcases key statistics about a business, such as the number of companies, templates, and queries, along with a description of how data analytics can help businesses grow. The design is responsive and visually appealing, with a modern layout and hover effects.

## Features

- **Stats Preview Card**: Displays key statistics about a business, including the number of companies, templates, and queries.
- **Responsive Design**: The card is fully responsive and adapts to both desktop and mobile views.
- **Hover Effects**: Interactive hover effects on the card for better user experience.
- **Modern Typography**: Uses Google Fonts ("Inter" and "Lexend Deca") for clean and modern typography.
- **Color Overlay**: A soft violet overlay is applied to the image for a visually appealing effect.
